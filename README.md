# Voice-controlled-car
A bluetooth app made using android studio to send voice commands to the HC-05 module which can be interfaced with Arduino. Right now the app sends basic voice commands like 'move forward', 'move back', 'move right' and 'move left' alone. The app sends data to the bluetooth module only under alternate audio button clicks. Will try to resolve that issue soon.
